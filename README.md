Practice recursion in JavaScript

Implement the following exercises in separated functions in both iterative (e.g., loops) and recursive functions, and add a comment for each line of your code

1. Calculate the sum of the natural number up to n. For example:  sum(n) = 1+2+3+...+n
2. Calculate the value of n to the m power
3. Find the nth Fibonacci number, e.g.,  The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,...
4. Print the integers in range (x, y). Example : range(2, 10) Expected Output  = > 2,3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 , 10
